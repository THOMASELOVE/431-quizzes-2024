# Instructions and Materials for Quiz 2

## Revisions to Quiz 2 since its original release on 2024-11-21.

1. fixed 2024-11-22: Question 3: fixed typo in first sentence: "on-site" rather than "on-side".
2. fixed 2024-11-22: Question 25: fixed typo: name of the outcome is `out`, not `outcome`.
3. fixed 2024-11-22: Question 19: added note to use 1000 bootstrap replications in options A and C.
4. fixed 2024-11-22: Question 21:
    - in Question 21 part a, dropped the misleading note on the Answer Form. Your regression equation should include the transformation you proposed in Question 20.
    - in Question 21 part b, added note to indicate that your predicted number of lines should be rounded to zero decimal places.
5. fixed 2024-11-22: Question 23: fixed typo in option b, where the dataset was incorrectly named. It is now `beds1` there, as it is in options a and c.

A comment on Question 7: It was my intention that people use the Question 7 output I have provided exclusively, rather than calculate things themselves, but I am aware that I may need multiple answers to be correct in the grading process in light of people ignoring this intention.

The [current version of the Quiz 2 PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/blob/main/quiz2/431-2024-quiz2.pdf) includes all of these changes, as does the [Answer Form](https://bit.ly/431-2024-quiz2-form).

## Instructions

- Here is a [PDF of all 31 pages of the Quiz 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/blob/main/quiz2/431-2024-quiz2.pdf). 
    - The instructions specify which R packages I used in preparing the quiz and its sketch. That doesn't mean I used every package listed there, but it does mean I didn't use any packages not listed there.
    - This is an open book, open notes quiz. You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website and that we've been reading in the class, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love (not even the teaching assistants.) You will be required to complete a short affirmation that you have obeyed these rules as part of submitting the Quiz.
    - If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly one way of getting help, and that is to ask via email to **Thomas dot Love at case dot edu**.
    - During the Quiz period (5 PM 2024-11-21 through 12:15 PM 2024-12-04) we will not answer questions about the Quiz through Campuswire or in TA office hours or in person or in the "Ask Me Anything" session on 2024-12-03. Instead, Dr. Love will respond to questions sent to the email address listed above. We promise to respond to all questions received before 10 AM on 2024-12-04 in a timely fashion.

## Data

In our Shared Drive, in the Quiz 2 Materials folder (and the data subfolder within it), I have provided six data files that are mentioned in the Quiz and which may be helpful to you. You'll also [find them here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2/data). The data are also on [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data), if you prefer grabbing them there.

The six data files for Quiz 2 are:

File Name | Rows | Columns | First Mentioned
:--------------- | ------: | -------: | -----:
beds1.csv | 102 | 3 | Question 23
beds2.csv | 51 | 3 | Question 23
nh_adult750.Rds | 750 | 16 | Question 6
nnyfs.Rds | 1518 | 45 | Question 10
projA23.xlsx | 42 | 4 | Question 19
surveyA.xlsx | 603 | 3 | Question 17

## Google Form Answer Sheet

All of your answers should be placed in the Google Form Answer Sheet located at <https://bit.ly/431-2024-quiz2-form>. The form will open for your responses **at 5 PM on Thursday 2024-11-21**.

- All of your answers must be submitted through the Google Form by noon on Wednesday 2024-12-04, without exception.
- The form will close at 12:15 PM that Wednesday (**so you will only have 15 minutes' leeway**), and no extensions will be made available, so do not wait until the last minute on Wednesday to submit your work.
- We will only accept responses through the Google Form.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return later, you can do this by:

1. completing the final question (the affirmation) which asks you to type in your full name, and then
2. submitting the quiz.

You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz as often as you like without losing your progress.
