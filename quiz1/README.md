# Instructions and Materials for Quiz 1

## Instructions

- [Here is a PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/blob/main/quiz1/431-2024-quiz1-first5pagesonly.pdf) of the first five pages (no questions are provided) of Quiz 1, so you can read the instructions in advance.
    - The instructions specify which R packages I used in preparing the quiz and its sketch. That doesn't mean I used every package listed there, but it does mean I didn't use any packages not listed there.
    - On Thursday at 5 PM, this document will be replaced by the complete 31-page PDF, which will include all of the questions, plus session information, as well as the instructions above.

## Data

In our Shared Drive, in the Quiz 1 Materials folder (and the data subfolder within it), I will provide three data sets that are mentioned in the Quiz and which may be helpful to you.

In addition, another Quiz question uses a specific data file (identified in the Instructions) from [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/tree/main/data-and-code), and that file also has the potential to be useful to you.
 
## Google Form Answer Sheet

All of your answers should be placed in the Google Form Answer Sheet located at <https://bit.ly/431-2024-quiz1-form>. The form will open for your responses **at 5 PM on Thursday 2024-10-10**.

- All of your answers must be submitted through the Google Form by noon on Wednesday 2024-10-16, without exception.
- The form will close at 1 PM that Wednesday (to allow you up to one hour's leeway), and no extensions will be made available, so do not wait until the last minute on Wednesday to submit your work.
- We will only accept responses through the Google Form.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return later, you can do this by:

1. completing the final question (the affirmation) which asks you to type in your full name, and then
2. submitting the quiz.

You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz as often as you like without losing your progress.
  
## Fair materials for me to draw from in Quiz 1

- [Classes](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main) 1-14, including the Slides and the READMEs,
- our [Course Book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) (sections 1-14),
- Spiegelhalter's *Art of Statistics* through Chapter 8,
- [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) Sections 1-8, 10-11, 16 and 28 
- [Labs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/blob/main/README.md) 1-4,
- our [Minute Papers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2024) after classes 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13
- our [Favorite Movies work](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/movies) through Class 12, and
- the Data and Proposal parts of [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2024/).

This does not mean I will actually address all of these things in the Quiz, and, in fact, I definitely will not.

## Sample Questions

In our Shared Google Drive folder, I've added a folder called Five Old Quiz Questions, which provides you with a PDF and a data set. The PDF gives you five questions from an old quiz as well as an answer sketch. The data set is used in some of those five questions. This is just meant to help worried students think about some of the kinds of questions I might ask on your Quiz 1. There's no requirement that you do anything with the Five Old Quiz Questions. Your Quiz will be different in many ways, but perhaps looking this over will calm you down if you're nervous.
